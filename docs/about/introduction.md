- **Security**: Prioritizes security by preventing known security exploits.
- **Flexibility**: Highly configurable, with the ability to disable unnecessary features.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a foundation for plugin development.

## What Pumpkin will not

- Function as a framework for building a server from scratch.

## Vanilla

Pumpkin is designed to replicate vanilla Minecraft logic as closely as possible,
ensuring a familiar gameplay experience. However, we've also added new features to enhance your gameplay.

### Redstone

Unlike other forks that may compromise vanilla redstone mechanics, Pumpkin maintains the original redstone behavior.
If you're looking to experiment with redstone modifications or seek performance optimizations, you have the flexibility to do so through our configurable settings.

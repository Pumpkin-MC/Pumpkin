[notes]
# Anvil/region file handling is currently in pumpkin-world, not pumpkin-nbt.
# This creates a boundary issue — Storage owns NBT format, WorldGen owns chunk IO.
# The Architect must rule on where region file code lives.
# Current pumpkin-nbt: 2611 lines, appears functional for basic read/write.

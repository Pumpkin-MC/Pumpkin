# Bootstrap — Read This First

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (project guide + blackboard protocol)
2. Read `.claude/prompts/{agent}.md` where `{agent}` is your role (check `.current-agent` or use what you were told)
3. Follow the prompt. It has everything: your scope, your decisions, your blackboard card, your task.

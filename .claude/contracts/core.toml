[notes]
# Core owns the most critical file: pumpkin/src/lib.rs (607 lines, not 23K).
# The tick loop (server/ticker.rs) must maintain 20 TPS under load.
# Tick order: packets → entities → redstone → chunks → outgoing packets
# Core also owns the command system (89 files, 13K lines).
# ARCH-023: Event-firing write access to world/mod.rs
# ONLY for wiring lifecycle event fire() calls (save, tick).
# Do NOT modify terrain generation, chunk loading, or structure placement.

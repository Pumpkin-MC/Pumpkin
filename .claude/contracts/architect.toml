[notes]
# The Architect is the only agent with access to shared crates.
# This comes with responsibility:
# - Every shared type/trait change must be flagged with ⚠️
# - Every conflict resolution must cite both agents' positions
# - Gap analysis must be thorough and actionable
# - Integration tests must cover cross-crate boundaries

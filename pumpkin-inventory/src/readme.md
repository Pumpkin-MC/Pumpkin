## The Player Inventory
The player inventory consists of 3 diffrent "inventories"
 - The main inventory, this includes all the hotbar slots and normal slots
 - Entity equipment, this includes all armor and the offhand and is an HashMap placed on the PlayerInventory struct
 - Player screen handler, this is the inventory that pops up when you open your inventory and includes the crafting table but also allows eyou to move items around

 While the first two are presistent with their items, the player screen handler moves/drops the items inside it once closed
